Please ensure that the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) between QM (red curve) and MM2 post-fit torsion (blue curve) has a decent fit.
Plots with *energy* contain the QM energy vs dihedral angle vs MM2 energy vs dihedral angle
Plots with *fit* contain the QM-MM1 (prefit torsion energy) vs dihedral angle and the fit spline
The first two numbers in plot are the rotatable bond in the parent, last two are the rotatable bond in the fragment
Plots with _use_weights in the filename are Boltzman fitted plots
Please ensure that the QM dipole and MM dipole match reasonably well
Please ensure that the RMSD between average QM potential and average MM potential is small
